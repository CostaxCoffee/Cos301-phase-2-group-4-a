\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Scalability}
		There is a anticipated increase in entry volume. We are expecting an exponential increase in students using the system. It is predicted that this year 750 students are registered for COS132 by next year there will be close to a thousand. We expect a 25 percent growth rate over the next two years. The system must scale and incorporate with the standard Computer Science website. 
	\item \textbf{Performance Requirements}
		Security, web portal and personalised applications will access the the directory server. They will performe various functions such as file access and Database access.
	\item \textbf{Maintanability}
		The system will be comprise of modules and using a Singleton design pattern to handle communication. Thus a centralised node that all communication will pass through between modules. This will allow us the easily edit/add/remove modules from the system.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Documentation}
				Using UML to keep source code organised. Automatic generation of classes.
			\item \textbf{Application Architecture Standards}
				Multilayer design compliance.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Reliability and Availability}
		Reliability will definitely be a priority. We will use a server that guarantees us at least 99 per uptime. This will probably be a University of pretoria server. Apply java OO and structured programming practices.
	\item \textbf{Security}
		Clients must not have file access to the server and the root assess of the system must only be allowed to authorised personal. Designing strong password policies and using \textbf{security methods}.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Authentication
			\item Encryption
			\item Access control
			\item Auditing
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Monitorability and Auditability}
		The server logs will allow us to monitor the system. These will be provided to us by the systems reporting module. Linux server logs will also allow us to audit the system and monitor its state.
	\item \textbf{Testability}
		Each function will be tested. But mathematical proofs for correctness is not necessary. Each part of the system must be tested. 
	\item \textbf{Usability}
		The web pages must be usable and follow a responsive design approach. This means the pages will display correctly on each screen size. We will follow google material design standards to ensure responsiveness.
	\item \textbf{Integrability}
		The system must be able to integrate into an existing computer science website. We must meet their standards when it comes to obtaining user information. We will conform to all communication standards to the system. Also provide our own integration library which will gain access through out singleton node.
\end{itemize}
