In this section discuss any architectural patterns or styles you have chosen to use together with the
rationale for using them.
For example, you might have decided to use layering in order to have lower level layers reusable
across different higher level layers (e.g. have a services layer usable by a web front-end and a
mobile-device client).
Discuss the elements of the architectural pattern (e.g. the different layers) and how these elements
are connected (e.g. the integration channels between the layers).
