 Integration Requirements
Channels
REST:Representational State Transfer architecture design to use as it is a simpler than SOAP and is a dynamic design.This will make it easier to implement and debug.A restful system can integrate well with HTTP as Rest sytems are optimized for web which makes it the perfect match.Restful systems needs to be client-server,so this means that there needs to be communication between the client and server which is vital in the buzz system.The communication between server and client requires the server to know the full state of the client to be able to process requests from the server.There is support for a lot of components to interact with each other and to be interchangeable.
 Protocols
-Http:Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the main protocol for all websites in the modern internet usage.It allows linking of the entire buzz forum together by a series of nodes which allows the users to easily navigate through the pages.
HTTPS:This is a more secure version of Http.This will be used for when the user logs in or there is sensitive data being sent over the channels.HTTPS is a combination of HTTP and TSL and SSH.This protocol will ensure that data is safely transported.
TCP/IP:The transfer communications and internet protocol are used hand in hand with http to help communicate with all the nodes.TCP is reliable and is able to check for errors in the transfer of the page over the IP.
SMTP:Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used to send emails.This protocol will be used to send emails to users of buzz to notify them of any changes.This will be easier then mailing manually and is prominently used in the web space.
IPv6:This will allow the users trying to  access buzz to be redirected and to allow them to be redirected or routed to the correct space on the internet.This provides access to buzz through the use of http and the TCP/IP protocols.
IPsec:Internet Protocol Security will allow for a secure IP and to ensure no harmful data is ever transmitted to the servers of buzz.
