Access channel requirements

The system will be accessed through:
•	Mobile devices, desktops and tablets by using web browsers (this includes all leading web browsers such as Google chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari and Internet explorer).
•	RESTful systems.
•	HTTP requests.
•	HTTPS.

The system must also be able to access a database on a server to retrieve student information. This will be achieved by using LDAP.
The buzz space should not only be accessible via desktop/laptop based web browsers, but also mobile devices.

Rendering of a mobile version of the website should thus be required in order to maximise ease of use for mobile users. Since a mobile app will not be developed, mobile sites should be of high importance when designing the website. The mobile websites does not need to be an entire different site, such as a .mobi website, where the main website would be for example .co.za. The need for a responsive website therefore arises.
